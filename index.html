<h2> About this dictionary </h2>

<p> <i>The Devil's Dictionary</i> is the work of the American writer <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose_Bierce">Ambrose Bierce</a>,
who also wrote the short story "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge". Bierce
began to write satirical dictionary definitions in 1875 and published
them sporadically in his newspaper columns in the ensuing decades. The
first collected edition of his dictionary appeared in 1906. While some
of Bierce's allusions may be outmoded, his observations of human frailty
remain sharp and true. </p>
